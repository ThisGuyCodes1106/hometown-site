        <h3>Experience the nightlife</h3>
        <p>Named after a famous salsa club, La Cheetah is situated in the basement of Max's in Glasgow's Merchant City. The tiny venue is accessed through the same doors as the public entrance. A small room with a bar, the DJ booth dominates the space. La Cheetah's limited capacity often offers the opportunity to see some of the biggest names in electronic music in an especially intimate environment.</p>
